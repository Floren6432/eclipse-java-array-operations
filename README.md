# eclipse-java-array-operations

A simple Java program created during my second year of university study, which performs basic array operations such as traversal, insertion, deletion, search, and update using user input via the console. 

TL;DR: Array Manipulation in Java.

Instructions: 
Just download the .zip file, 
then open Eclipse and go to File > Import > Existing Projects into Workspace to import it, 
or simply drop the folder into your Eclipse workspace.
